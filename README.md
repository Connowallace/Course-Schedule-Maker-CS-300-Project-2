# Course-Schedule-Maker-CS-300-Project-2
Parse course information from a CSV file into a binary search tree. 

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was to take an unordered list of course and print them out into an ordered schedule or look up details on a specific course.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structures, like any other form of storage and/or flow, are varied because they are designed to handle different situations. Many data structures could be used to handle any given problem. Choosing a data structure that is appropriate for the work you want to and well suited for the size of the work you will be doing is necessary to ensure that programs work efficiently.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Moving back into C++ is always a slow process. For me, I struggle with string manipulation and formatted printing. Luckily there are many online sources that cover how to do this. The hard part is choosing which of the eight methods to use.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working with a binary search tree has helped me become much more comfortable using recursion. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Frustration with the size of the early assignments led me to break up this project into much smaller classes. I think both the user menu and BST class will be something I could easily use again in the future.
